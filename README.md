# [Responsive Fictious Book Club Project](https://tariq-k-dev.github.io/responsive-club-project/)

A single page website that uses CSS media queries to make it responsive on smaller screen sizes.  JavaScript is used to generate calendar with the number of days generated based on the year and month, and to set the `.active-day` CSS class for the scheduled day.  JavaScript is also used to add event listeners to navigate to the appropriate page section, and set the link to have `.active` CSS class.  The form under the Registration section is non-functional, and doesn't submit any data.
